# üåä FamilyFinanceFlow  

**A mobile-friendly finance tracker for families** | *Node.js + React + SQLite*  

## üìñ Storytelling  

Meet **FamilyFinanceFlow** ‚Äì the solution I built to end the monthly chaos of splitting bills, tracking shared expenses, and projecting future balances in my household.  

### The Problem:  
Every month, my family faced the same frustrations:  
- "Who owes what for the rent?"  
- "How much will we spend on groceries next month?"  
- "Can we afford this new couch if we pay in 12 installments?"  

Spreadsheets got messy, and finance apps didn‚Äôt handle **shared expenses**, **installment tracking**, or **family-specific budgeting** well.  

### The Solution:  
I created **FamilyFinanceFlow** to:  
‚úÖ **Track fixed costs** (rent, subscriptions, insurance)  
‚úÖ **Split expenses** fairly between family members  
‚úÖ **Auto-calculate installment plans** (showing future impacts)  
‚úÖ **Project monthly balances** with interactive charts  
‚úÖ **Plan future purchases** based on savings  

Built with **React** for a mobile-friendly UI and **Node.js + SQLite** for lightweight data storage. Perfect for running locally at home (`localhost` or WiFi access) or deploying later.
